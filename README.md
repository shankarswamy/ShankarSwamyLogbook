# ShankarSwamyLogbook
My logbook based on TiddlyWiki.  No support offered or implied, if you decide to use this.  (Don't ask me!)

If I did not point you to this and you came here somehow, likely you won't find anything useful here.
But you're welcome and you're on your own.

If you make money off of anything here, fine with me; but don't get me into any litigations - most stuff here
is already in public domain and likely not my original work.
